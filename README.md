# cinema_search
Project 1, building a front end web application from scratch.

Team: Phil, Nailah & Piers

## Description
We wanted to create a user friendly film research site designed to give the user a brief flavour of a film that they might be interested in.
We wanted the site to make 2 API calls. The first is to the OMDB site, the second to YouTube.
We wanted the page to have an option for the user to input a film of their choice.
After the user had clicked on the search button, or return / enter, we wanted the browser to display a poster and some interesting facts about the film. We wanted then to create a link where the user could click on a button to play a trailer or short clip from the film.
We wanted the dashboard to clear and show information for a different film when the user updated their input.
We wanted the previous user inputs to be saved to screen as buttons.
We wanted the saved buttons to be able to be selected by the user and update the browser when clicked on.
We wanted to develop our skills of using server-side APIs.
We wanted to develop our skills of using github branching workflow.
We wanted to develop our skills of agile software development.
We wanted to store previous user searches in local storage and make them available to be resused.
We wanted to be able to clear searches.
We wanted to be able to ensure that the app could continue to run despite potential invalid inputs from the user.
We wanted to reinforce our learning of html, JavaScript, CSS and jQuery through this project.
We wanted to deploy our finished product and check it had no errors.
